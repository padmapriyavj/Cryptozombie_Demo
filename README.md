## Project Information

### Starter Code Usage
This project was built using the provided starter code as a foundation. All enhancements and 
improvements have been made on top of that base. 

### Improvements Made
#### 1. Built a Nicer Website
   ```
   ● Enhanced UI/UX: 
        We overhauled the website design to ensure it is more visually appealing and 
        user-friendly. This includes a modern layout, improved navigation, and better 
        responsiveness on various devices. 
   ● Responsive Design: 
        The website now adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring 
        a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
   ```
#### 2. Added Images to Demo Zombies
   ```
    ● Zombie Image Display: 
        When a zombie is created, its details are now accompanied by a corresponding image. 
        This visual representation helps users better understand and engage with the character. 
    ● Dynamic Image Generation: 
        During zombie level-up events, a random zombie image is generated. This adds an 
        element of surprise and variety, making the experience more fun and dynamic.
   ```
#### 3. Deployed to Sepolia Testnet 
   ```
   ● Test Network Deployment: 
        The smart contract has been successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet. This allows 
        users and developers to interact with the DApp in a live testing environment before any 
        mainnet deployment. 
    ● Improved Accessibility: 
        By deploying on Sepolia, we ensured broader accessibility and provided a more robust 
        testing ground for smart contract interactions.
   ```
#### 4. Additional Features 
   ```
    ● Automatic Refresh: 
        The DApp interface automatically updates in real time without requiring manual 
        refreshes. This ensures that users see the latest changes and events as they occur. 
    ● Separate Column for Kitties (partial implementation): 
        A dedicated section now displays kitties. This feature clearly shows which zombie can 
        interact with (feed on) a kitty, providing better clarity and organization within the 
        interface. 
    ● Dynamic Code Implementation: 
        We refactored and optimized both the smart contract and the frontend code. The 
        dynamic code implementation improves performance, reduces load times, and makes 
        future updates more manageable.
